<h1>Micro URL Shortener</h1>

Here is a simple url shortener written in python using bottle and sqlite3.

<h2>Installation</h2>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/laingcc/micro-url-shortener
cd micro-url-shortener
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

<h2>Why?</h2>

I was feeling like I needed to put something together for my own sanity. I wanted a simple project to put together on a friday night. 

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
In the future I would like to add a pastebin, perhaps some authentication and perhaps a browser extension.
