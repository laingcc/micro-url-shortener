<h1>Yet another url shortener</h1>

Here is a simple url shortener written in python using bottle and sqlite3.

<h2>Installation</h2>

```bash
git clone {{put link to repo here}}
cd url-shortener
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

<h2>Why?</h2>

I was feeling like I needed to put something together for my own sanity. This is undoubtedly the simplest url shortener I could think of. It's not meant to be used in production, but it's a good starting point for anyone who wants to build their own url shortener.
